- current system is inflexible
    - some people want more granularity
- would be nice to let commanders do gear/build inspect

1. someone fills out the static request form
    - data is dumped into a sheet in the spreadsheet
2. manual inspection

Team creation:
1. copy an existing time

- team data from LBData and dps.report through function or manual
- guild summary of times, both average of best, best, per team, entries
    - issue: can't do data against google sheets queries
    - want:
        - most improved (over time frame)
- team color should be consistent
- possibly create:
    - discord role
    - discord channel

- automation!
- documentation!!!
